TODO:

> Work out the "value pipeline" for the reporting engine  (Evaluate > [Dereference] > [Transform])

> [Non-selectable fields - control mappings?]

> Reference - static data vs complex type (e.g. Project)

> Prototype Complex Filter : Reference => Guid / Guids

> Prototype Complex Filter : Mapping => On support provided filter by Project.Created date range (report reference includes entity as property)

> [SORT OUT REFERENCES/MAPPING AND THE REST SHOULD FALL INTO PLACE]

> ReportFilterEditor (used on both)

> Ensure reporting enums use exhaustive switch

> Is it worth supporting multi-value filters? [think it's a no]

> Rename boolean domain poperties to use the Is prefix

> ReportReference / ReportLookup  ????

> Heartbeats

> Project_XXX fields (or whatever demormalised is appropriate) either realtime or via dirty tracking

> Dirty projects (needs heartbeats to update data) + need filterable update statements to avoid stamping on data

> Code Editor (+ Terminal Editor) => Terminal 2.0

> Team Support Request Dashboard filters/grid?

> User title optional

> Remove Iframe resizer, not needed any more

> Tab selection of controls (think it's kinda important now) - mainly dates to do

> Project Metrics Calculation (Lazy?)

> Change Log Utility : Format Primative (NULL -> (NONE) + on empty strings)

> Google Recaptcha 3 on the support request form (https://dev.to/rodrigokamada/adding-the-google-recaptcha-v3-to-an-angular-application-kge)

> Project / Support Request Change Status => Unlock (to mirror can unlock permission) [API should mirror claims]

> More mobile goodness

> Remove IStaticDataWithFreeText (leave Has method with lambda)
