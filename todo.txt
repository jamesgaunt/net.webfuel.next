> Code Editor (+ Terminal Editor) => Terminal 2.0

> Team Support Request Dashboard filters/grid?

> User title optional

> Project Summary Service (cached project summaries for user interface enrichment)

> Tab selection of controls (think it's kinda important now) - mainly dates to do

> Project Metrics Calculation (Lazy - or just rely on reporting engine now)

> Change Log Utility : Format Primative (NULL -> (NONE) + on empty strings)

> Google Recaptcha 3 on the support request form (https://dev.to/rodrigokamada/adding-the-google-recaptcha-v3-to-an-angular-application-kge)

> Project / Support Request Change Status => Unlock (to mirror can unlock permission) [API should mirror claims]
