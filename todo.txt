TODO:

> Purchase and setup on new domain - send form code to ICL for their web administrators

> Free Text Boxes (integrate into select somehow - should be able to compartmentalise a lot of logic)
	- presence of FreeText on the selected item
	- presence of FreeTextFormControl

> Permissions (look again at asp.net core infrastructure)

> Tab selection of controls (think it's kinda important now)

> Can we wrap/encapsulate any more controller behaviours? 

> Repository entity pristene tracking?
